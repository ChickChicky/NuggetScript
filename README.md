# NuggetScript
## A very flexible programming language I am writing

(At the moment it is not really usable)

I believe originally it was just supposed to be a higher-level programming language for my CPU but it tourns out that I need a scripting language of other projects so NuggetScript will also be used for this.

This language does not enforce types, they are optionnal, but depending on the implementation or how you run / compile it it might need them.
NuggetScript is planned to be a compilable language for custom very simple architectures, like my CPU. It could run on different environments, like an interpreter (what I am currently working on in JS right now), or a compiler that could allow it to run code on an Arduino or simple CPUs. I'm planning on having two types of compilation, actual compiled NuggetScript code, and embedded interpreter. The second option would be very useful in case of compatibility issues.

I also plan on remaking all the interpreter / lexer / parser code in C++ to make it run much faster, but the compiler part will most likely still be done in Javascript.

There are some small examples that *may* run depending on the state of the project.

I also have to make a better README file, but I am working on other projects, so this one is not really my priority.
